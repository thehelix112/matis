# matis
This is my PhD project, it is an anomaly detection system demonstrating my thesis in distributed simulation.

This project was born from prior work undertaken jointly between University of Ballarat and the Defence Science Technology Organisation in Victoria, Australia. I was lead developer on that work, and it provided the technical foundation for this work.

Matis is an example of the thesis of my doctoral degree: abstracting out logical entities that programs relate to (typically at the library or API level) is a more accurate basis for models and enforcement of their correct behaviour.
